This project, github.com/decbr1/writing-an-interpreter-in-go, is my following
of the eponymous book by Thorsten Ball. The book's text itself is copyrighted
by Thorsten Ball and all rights are reserved, but the code produced from the
contents of the book - and found online on the author's github - are specifically
licensed under the MIT license. How lovely! Where my code differs from the original
author's, and the work is enough 'of my own' for it to require a separate licence,
I have placed it under the same MIT license to the best of my ability.
Below is the license text as found in the original repository.
